Solve for the issue-
Q) Put the condition for OverWeight?

# Code For BMI Calculator

height=float(input("Please Enter Your Height(Metre)"))
weight=float(input("Please Enter Your Weight(Kilogram)"))
bmi=(weight/(height**2))
print("Your BMI is : ",bmi)
if(bmi<18.5):
    print(bmi,"UnderWeight")
elif(bmi>18.5 and bmi<24.9):
    print(bmi,"NormalWeight")
elif(bmi>30):
    print(bmi,"Obesity")
